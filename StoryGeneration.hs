    Current idea: Generate from an event
    Concepts:
        derivation: 
            + from Cms (priming, prototype)
            + using knowledge that related to emotion 
            + (proving) from intention
        updating:
            + abstraction: recognizing from current fabula structure
            + expansion: needed by proving 
            + reforming:
        intention:
            + implementing an abstract structure 
                (abstract structure may be derived by requirements of emotion)

    note: application of commonsense
